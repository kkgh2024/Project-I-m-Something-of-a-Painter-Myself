# Project-I-m-Something-of-a-Painter-Myself
This project uses generative adversarial networks (GANs) to replicate the unique styles of famous artists like Claude Monet, either in photos or from scratch. While GANs are good at mimicking objects, creating art that resembles real masterpieces still requires both art and science. The goal is to see if GANs can trick classifiers into believing the generated art is an authentic Monet.
## Challenge:
A GAN includes at least two neural networks: a generator model and a discriminator model. The generator creates the images, and for this [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/gan-getting-started), it should produce images in Monet's style. The discriminator trains the generator by attempting to distinguish between real and generated images. The two models work against each other, with the generator trying to fool the discriminator and the discriminator striving to correctly identify real versus generated images. The task is to build a GAN that generates 7,000 to 10,000 Monet-style images.
